Semantic Artifacts
==================

This repository is a curated collection of semantic web assets, including Shape Expressions (ShEx), OWL ontologies, SSSOM mappings, RDF vocabularies, and related resources. These artifacts are intended to support data interoperability, validation, and integration within ERDERA. Whether youâ€™re modeling data, aligning ontologies, or validating RDF graphs, this repository provides reusable components to help build FAIR and machine-readable data ecosystems.
